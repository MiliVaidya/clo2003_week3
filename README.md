Learning About Linux

Introduction:
In this assignment a brief history and information is given regarding Linux. How Linux came to be known and became famous in the world of development. GNU/Linux is a Unix-like but NOT UNIX kernel.

Section 1: Linux History:

• Write about the origins and history of Linux.
In 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was formed and since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU Project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system. As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL).Linux is a free operating system kernel created by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in the early 1990s. 

• Mention the key contributors (e.g., Linus Torvalds) and the development of the Linux kernel.
Linus Torvalds created a kernel in 1991 and was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU(GNU Not Unix) operating system (OS) which was created to be a free replacement for Unix. On 5 October 1991, Torvalds announced the first "official" version of Linux, version 0.02.

• Explain how Linux has evolved and its significance in modern computing.
Linux is known for its stability and reliability. Generally, Linux is considered more secure than other operating systems. Linux has been significantly influenced by its adoption in enterprise environments.


• Section 2: Linux Distributions:

• Explain what Linux distributions are and why they are important.
Linux distributions consist of software packages. These packages contain specific files, applications or services.

• Provide examples of popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc.
Ubuntu Cinnamon, Ubuntu Mobile, BackBox, Element OS, Linux Lite, Nova

• Describe the differences between various distributions.
the main difference between the distributions is target audiences and systems.

• Section 3: Basic Linux Commands:
• List and explain some common Linux commands.
alias: command helps to define temporary aliases in a shell session. 
exit: With it, you can end a shell session.
echo: The echo command displays defined text in the terminal 

• Examples:
• ls: List files and directories.
• cd: Change directories.
• pwd: Print working directory.
• mkdir: Create a new directory.
• cp: Copy files or directories.
• mv: Move or rename files or directories.
• rm: Remove files or directories.
• sudo: Execute a command as the superuser.
• Conclusion:
• Summarize what has been learned and why Linux is a valuable skill.
